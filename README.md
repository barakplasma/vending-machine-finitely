# Vending Machine Finite State Machine

This project is a brief example of a finite state machine library built on top of a [Gatsby](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/gatsby-functions) app with serverless functions for creating mock/real data that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Development / Local Running
Use `now dev` to develop locally, and visit the link it produces to see the live local version.
For example, it'll provide the graphql endpoint: `http://localhost:51514/___graphql` and you should visit the root `http://localhost:51514/`

## Deploying this Example

This project is deployed via the now.sh github integration. A simple push to the master branch will build and deploy this project via CI/CD to the URL [https://vending-machine-finitely.barakplasma.now.sh/](https://vending-machine-finitely.barakplasma.now.sh/)

Alternatively, you can deploy this with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
# vending-machine-finitely
