# Vending Machine Finite State Machine

This project is a brief example of a finite state machine library built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) app with serverless functions for creating mock/real data that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## Development / Local Running
Use `now dev` to develop locally, and visit the link it produces to see the live local version.
For example, it'll provide the graphql endpoint: `http://localhost:51514/___graphql` and you should visit the root `http://localhost:51514/`

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy this with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
# vending-machine-finitely
