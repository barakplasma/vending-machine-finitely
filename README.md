# Gatsby Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) app with serverless functions that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Gatsby on Now, you can use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ gatsby new gatsby-site
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Gatsby example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
